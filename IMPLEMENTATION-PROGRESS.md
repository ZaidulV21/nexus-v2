# SINGLE WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION - PROGRESS REPORT

**Date:** 2026-07-20  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

---

## Completed Features

### ✅ Backend Implementation (100%)

#### 1. Quotation Module — Client-Only Ownership
**Files Modified:**
- `quotation.types.ts` — `clientId: string` is required in `CreateQuotationInput`
- `quotation.validation.ts` — Schema enforces `clientId` with message "Client ID is required"
- `quotation.service.ts` — `create()` throws `ValidationError` if `clientId` is missing. Also verifies `client.sourceLeadId` exists
- `quotation.service.test.ts` — All tests updated and passing

#### 2. Lead Module — Read-Only After Conversion + Archive/Restore
**Files Modified:**
- `lead.service.ts` — `updateLeadServiceStatus()` checks `lead.convertedAt` and blocks manual updates. Also blocks updates to services already at `PROJECT CREATED`
- `applyQuotationWorkflowStatus()` preserved for automatic post-conversion updates. Skips services already at or past target status, swallows illegal-transition errors gracefully
- **NEW: `archive()`** — Archives an unconverted lead with mandatory reason, records timeline + audit entries
- **NEW: `restore()`** — Restores an archived lead, records timeline + audit entries
- `lead.repository.ts` — Added `archive()` and `restore()` methods; `list()` now supports `archived` filter
- `lead.types.ts` — Added `ArchiveLeadInput` interface
- `lead.validation.ts` — Added `archiveLeadSchema` with mandatory reason
- `lead.controller.ts` — Added `archive` and `restore` endpoints
- `lead.routes.ts` — Added `PATCH /:id/archive` and `PATCH /:id/restore` routes (Admin only)
- `lead.service.test.ts` — 7 new tests for archive/restore (16 total lead tests)

#### 3. Dashboard & Search — Excludes Archived Leads
- `dashboard.repository.ts` — `countLeadsBySource()` now filters `archivedAt: null`

#### 4. Pagination — Supports Archived Filter
- `pagination.ts` — Added `archived?: boolean` to `PaginationParams`, parsed from `?archived=true` query param

#### 5. Client Module — Already Correct (No Changes Needed)
- Conversion requires at least one service past `NEW`/`CONTACTED`
- `sourceLeadId` set on Client creation
- All 4 client tests passing

#### 6. Project Module — Client-Linked, Quotation-Triggered
- `project.service.ts:create()` validates quotation is `ACCEPTED`, copies services into Project Services
- Calls `applyQuotationWorkflowStatus()` with `'PROJECT CREATED'` after creation

#### 7. Global Search — All 7 Modules
**Files Modified:**
- `search.types.ts` — Added `SearchEntityType` union and `SEARCH_ENTITY_TYPES` constant
- `search.service.ts` — Full rewrite: expanded searchable fields, `type` filter, `include` for related entities, `RESULTS_PER_TYPE = 15`, conditional query execution
- `search.controller.ts` — Added `type` query parameter validation
- `search.service.test.ts` — 10 tests (type filtering, includes, archived exclusion, whitespace trim)

#### 8. Notification Center — In-App Notifications
**Files Created:**
- `notifications.types.ts` — `CreateInAppNotificationInput`, `ListNotificationsParams`, `EventNotificationMapping`, `NotificationType`, `NotificationPriority`, `NotificationRecipientType`
- `notifications.repository.ts` — CRUD: `createInAppNotification`, `createManyInAppNotifications`, `listByRecipient`, `countByRecipient`, `countUnread`, `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead`, `findAllAdminUserIds`
- `notifications.service.ts` — `EVENT_NOTIFICATION_MAP` (17 admin + 9 client event mappings); `emitEvent()` creates in-app notifications (fire-and-forget); `listByRecipient`, `getUnreadCount`, `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead`
- `notifications.controller.ts` — `list` (paginated), `unreadCount`, `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead`
- `notifications.routes.ts` — `GET /`, `GET /unread-count`, `PATCH /read-all`, `PATCH /:id/read` (all authenticated)
- `notifications.service.test.ts` — 13 tests

**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `InAppNotification` model with indexes on `[recipientId, recipientType]` and `[recipientId, recipientType, isRead]`
- `prisma/migrations/20260720010000_add_in_app_notifications/migration.sql`
- `app.ts` — Notification routes mounted at `/api/notifications`
- `client.service.ts` — Added `clientId` to `client.account.created` payload
- `quotation.service.ts` — Added `clientId` to `quotation.sent`/`quotation.accepted` payloads

#### 2. Lead Detail Page (`LeadDetailPage.tsx`)
- Conversion dialog title: "Convert this lead to a client?"
- **NEW: Archive button** — Shows confirmation dialog with mandatory reason textarea
- **NEW: Restore button** — Restores archived lead with confirmation
- **NEW: Archived badge** — Shows "Archived" label in page header when lead is archived

#### 3. Lead Services Panel (`LeadServicesPanel.tsx`)
- Shows **"Read-Only (Auto-Sync)"** badge with Lock icon after conversion

#### 4. Leads List Page (`LeadsPage.tsx`)
- **NEW: Active/Archived toggle** — Tab-style filter to switch between active and archived leads

#### 5. Frontend Types & Services

- `app/PortalLayout.tsx` — Added bell icon with unread count + Notifications nav item
- `routes/routes.ts` — Added `notifications` and `portal.notifications` routes
- `App.tsx` — Added admin and portal notification routes

### ✅ Current Lead → Client → Quotation → Project Workflow

```
Lead (NEW → CONTACTED → QUALIFIED → SITE_VISIT → QUOTE_PREPARING)
  ↓
Admin converts Lead → Client (requires qualified service, valid email)
  ↓
Client account created, credentials emailed, sourceLeadId set
  ↓
Admin creates quotation (clientId required, enforced backend + frontend)
  ↓
Admin approves quotation
  ↓
Admin sends quotation → Lead Service status → QUOTE_SENT (automatic)
  ↓
Client requests revision → Lead Service → NEGOTIATION (automatic)
  ↓
Admin revises & resends → Lead Service → QUOTE_SENT (automatic)
  ↓
Client accepts quotation → Lead Service → APPROVED (automatic)
  ↓
Project automatically created → Lead Service → PROJECT_CREATED (automatic)
  ↓
Project execution → IN_PROGRESS → ON_HOLD → COMPLETED → CANCELLED
```

### ✅ Client-Only Quotation Ownership

- Quotations require `clientId` — backend rejects creation without it (`quotation.service.ts:92-96`)
- Frontend only presents Client selection (`QuotationFormDrawer.tsx:173-198`)
- Converted Leads cannot create new quotations (server-side enforcement)
- Pre-conversion quotations with `leadId` are migrated to Client on conversion via `quotationRepository.migrateLeadQuotationsToClient()`

### ✅ Automatic Lead Service Status Synchronization

Implemented via `applyQuotationWorkflowStatus()` (`lead.service.ts:181-212`):

| Event | Automatic Status | Trigger Location |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Admin sends quotation | QUOTE_SENT | `quotation.service.ts:285` |
| Client requests revision | NEGOTIATION | `quotation.service.ts:336` |
| Client accepts quotation | APPROVED | `quotation.service.ts:397` |
| Client rejects quotation | NEGOTIATION | `quotation.service.ts:466` |
| Project created | PROJECT_CREATED | `project.service.ts:171-176` |

The function resolves the Lead via `resolveSourceLeadId()` (`quotation.service.ts:76-86`), which traces through `quotation.leadId`, `quotation.client.sourceLeadId`, `quotation.lead?.id`, and finally a direct client lookup — ensuring Lead Services update automatically even after conversion.

### ✅ Client.sourceLeadId Historical Linkage

- Set during Lead → Client conversion (`client.service.ts:72`)
- Used by `resolveSourceLeadId()` for automatic status sync (`quotation.service.ts:76-86`)
- Used by `projectService.create()` to verify Lead/Client relationship (`project.service.ts:104-107`)
- Historical traceability only — not used for ownership decisions

### ✅ Timeline/Audit Log/Notifications Synchronization

- Timeline entries created for Lead progression, conversion, quotation events, project events
- Audit logs record all CRUD operations and status transitions
- Notifications sent on key events (quotation sent, credentials emailed)
- All remain functional through the single workflow

### ✅ Bug Fix: Notification Badge/List Inconsistency

**Root cause:** `notificationService.list()` used `api.get()` which calls `apiRequest()`, returning `json.data` — a raw array from the backend's `paginated()` response. But `NotificationPanel.tsx` and `NotificationsPage.tsx` read `data?.items`, which is `undefined` on an array, so the list always rendered empty while the badge (which uses `api.get('/notifications/unread-count')` returning `{ count }` via `ok()`) worked correctly.

**Fix:** Changed `notificationService.list()` to use `api.getPaginated<InAppNotification>()` which correctly wraps the response as `{ items: T[], meta: PaginationMeta }`. Removed the unused `NotificationListResponse` interface.

**Files changed:** `nexus-frontend/src/services/notificationService.ts`

**Verification:**
- Badge count equals the number of unread notifications displayed
- Mark as Read updates both list and badge immediately via query invalidation
- Mark All Read clears both list and badge correctly

### ✅ "Quotation has no linked Lead" Bug — Fixed

The old error message `"Quotation has no linked Lead"` has been **removed from all source code**. The `resolveSourceLeadId()` function (`quotation.service.ts:76-86`) now has a robust fallback chain:
1. Check `quotation.leadId` directly
2. Check `quotation.client.sourceLeadId`
3. Check `quotation.lead?.id`
4. Fetch client by `clientId` and check `client.sourceLeadId`
5. Final error: `"Quotation has no Lead or Client owner"` (only if all lookups fail)

The old error message only exists in `SINGLE-WORKFLOW-COMPLETE.md:279` (historical documentation).

### ✅ Company Settings — Centralized Configuration & Integration

**Backend:**
- `company.types.ts` — `UpdateCompanySettingsInput` with 45 optional fields across 5 sections
- `company.validation.ts` — `updateCompanySettingsSchema` with Zod validation (email, URL, length constraints)
- `company.repository.ts` — Singleton pattern: `find()`, `create()`, `update()` (upsert on fixed ID)
- `company.service.ts` — `get()` (creates defaults if none exist), `update()` (with timeline + audit + branding cache clear), `updateField()` (for file uploads with per-field audit)
- `company.controller.ts` — `get` (any auth user), `update` (Admin-only), `upload` (Cloudinary with local fallback, file type/size validation, field whitelist)
- `company.branding.ts` — `getCompanyBranding()` + `clearBrandingCache()` for downstream consumers (PDFs, emails, invoices)
- `company.routes.ts` — `GET /api/company/settings`, `PATCH /api/company/settings`, `POST /api/company/settings/upload?field=...`
- `cloudinary.provider.ts` — Cloudinary `StorageProvider` (stream upload, returns secure URL)
- `env.ts` — Added `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_FOLDER`
- `app.ts` — Removed `/uploads` static middleware (no longer needed with Cloudinary)
- `notifications/channels/email.channel.ts` — Reads company branding (name, logo, sender, address) and includes in email payload
- `company.service.test.ts` — 5 tests (get existing, get with default creation, update with timeline+audit, audit before/after state, file upload)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `CompanySetting` model: 47 fields across Company Info, Business Settings, Bank Details, Email Settings, Social Links
- `prisma/migrations/20260720020000_add_company_settings/migration.sql`

**Frontend — Settings CRUD:**
- `services/companyService.ts` — `get()`, `update()`, `uploadFile(field, file)` with typed inputs
- `queries/useCompany.ts` — `useCompanySettings`, `useUpdateCompanySettings`, `useUploadCompanyFile` (React Query hooks with cache invalidation)
- `pages/settings/CompanySettingsPage.tsx` — Full settings page with 5 sectioned cards, file upload previews, unsaved changes warning, reset, save
- `types/index.ts` — `CompanySetting` interface with all 47 fields
- `queries/keys.ts` — `company: { all, detail }` query keys
- `routes/routes.ts` — `companySettings: '/settings/company'`
- `App.tsx` — `/settings/company` route

**Frontend — Integration (Company Settings as single source of truth):**
- `components/layout/CompanyLogo.tsx` — Shared `CompanyLogo` (renders `<img>` from settings.logoUrl) + `CompanyName` (reads settings.companyName)
- `components/layout/DynamicFavicon.tsx` — Dynamically updates `<link rel="icon">` from settings.faviconUrl
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Company Logo + Company Name replace hardcoded "Nexus" branding
- `pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` — Company Logo + Company Name on login screen
- `app/PortalLayout.tsx` — Company Logo + Company Name in client portal header
- `pages/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` — Company Profile summary card (logo, name, email, phone, city/state, Edit button) replaces bare "Open Company Settings" button
- `app/providers.tsx` — `DynamicFavicon` wired globally for all routes

#### Previous Bug Fixes
- **Logo upload preview** — `localStorageProvider.save()` returned a bare filename. Fixed by: (1) adding `express.static` for `/uploads` in `app.ts`, (2) company controller now returns `/uploads/${filename}` as serveable URL path. (Now replaced by Cloudinary — no longer needed.)
- **Save "Invalid payload"** — `onSubmit` converted `''` → `null`. Backend Zod rejects `null` (accepts `string | undefined` only). Fixed by skipping empty/null/undefined values in payload instead of converting to `null`.
- **Cloudinary PDF delivery blocked** — Cloudinary Media Library default "Blocked for delivery" caused uploaded PDFs to return HTTP 401 Unauthorized. Fixed by adding `access_control: [{ access: 'public_read' }]` to upload params in `cloudinary.provider.ts`. Images were unaffected. New uploads deliver publicly; existing URLs unchanged.

### ✅ Admin Dashboard — Real-Time Business Overview

**Backend:**
- `dashboard.repository.ts` — Expanded with 12 aggregate queries: `countTotalLeads`, `countTotalClients`, `countTotalQuotations`, `countTotalInvoices`, `countProjectsByStatus`, `countPendingQuotations`, `countProjectsOnHold`, `invoicesAwaitingPayment`, `monthlyRevenue`, `previousMonthCounts`, `thisMonthCounts`, `recentTimelineEvents`. All queries use `archivedAt: null` for leads and exclude cancelled invoices.
- `adminDashboard.service.ts` — `getSummary(adminUserId?)` returns structured data: KPIs (10 metrics), comparisons (this vs previous month for 5 entity types), charts (lead services by status, leads by source, monthly revenue, projects by status), recent activity (last 10 timeline events with clickable links), upcoming items (pending quotations, projects on hold, overdue invoices, awaiting payment, unread notifications). `monthlyRevenue()` aggregates last 12 months of invoiced vs received amounts.
- `dashboard.controller.ts` — Passes `req.user.id` to service for unread notification count
- `tests/adminDashboard.service.test.ts` — 6 tests (revenue totals, entity counts, upcoming items, charts data, comparisons, recent activity)

**Frontend:**
- `pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` — REWRITTEN: Full dashboard with 10 KPI cards (Active Projects, Total Leads, Clients, Quotations, Invoices, Revenue Invoiced, Revenue Received, Outstanding, Pending Quotations, Projects In Progress), 4 charts (Lead Services by Status bar chart, Leads by Source donut, Monthly Revenue grouped bar, Projects by Status donut), Recent Activity (last 10 timeline events with icons, clickable links), Upcoming Items widget (pending quotations, projects on hold, overdue invoices, awaiting payment, unread notifications), Quick Actions (8 buttons for create/view), Search shortcut (Ctrl+K hint), Notifications summary (unread count + view all). All responsive with loading skeletons.
- `services/dashboardService.ts` — REWRITTEN: Typed interfaces (`AdminDashboardSummary`, `DashboardKpis`, `DashboardComparisons`, `DashboardCharts`, `DashboardActivity`, `DashboardUpcoming`). Fetches from `GET /dashboard/admin/summary`.
- `components/ui/StatCard.tsx` — Added `description` prop for optional sub-text
- `components/ui/Charts.tsx` — Added `GroupedBarChart` component for monthly revenue (dual bars: invoiced vs received)
- `queries/keys.ts` — Added `dashboard.adminSummary` query key

## Remaining Work

There are no unfinished tasks for the core single-workflow implementation. All backend, frontend, tests, and builds are complete and passing.

### What Company Settings Now Provides
- **Upload storage**: Cloudinary (logo, favicon, signature, stamp, QR code) — no local `/uploads` dependency
- **Admin sidebar**: Displays company logo + company name from settings
- **Login page**: Displays company logo + company name
- **Client portal**: Displays company logo + company name in header
- **Settings page**: Company Profile summary card (logo, name, contact info, Edit button)
- **Browser favicon**: Dynamically updated from `settings.faviconUrl`
- **Email channel**: Reads company branding (name, logo, sender, address) for future template use
- **Downstream consumers**: `getCompanyBranding()` + `clearBrandingCache()` available for PDF generation, invoice branding, quotation headers, etc.

### ✅ PDF Generation Module — Professional Branded Documents

**Backend:**
- `pdf.types.ts` — Types: `PdfDocumentType`, `CompanyBrandingData`, `PdfLineItem` (with `serviceName`), `PdfRecipient` (with `gstin`), `PdfQuotationData` (with `validUntil`, `notes`, `termsAndConditions`, `paymentTerms`), `PdfInvoiceData` (with `displayStatus`), `GeneratePdfInput`, `PdfGenerationResult`
- `templates/base.template.ts` — Reusable `BASE_TEMPLATE` with `createDocument()`, `drawHeader()`, `drawDocumentTitle()`, `drawRecipientBlock()`, `drawTable()`, `drawTotals()`, `drawBankDetails()`, `drawSignatureAndStamp()`, `drawFooter()`, `drawAmountInWords()`, `drawWatermark()` (diagonal rotated watermark for DRAFT/REJECTED statuses), `formatCurrency()`, `formatDate()`; page numbering via `bufferedPageRange()`
- `templates/quotation.template.ts` — Enhanced quotation PDF: status watermark overlay (DRAFT/REJECTED), Valid Until date in document info, client GSTIN in recipient block, 6-column table (Description, Service, Qty, Rate, Tax %, Amount), Notes/Terms & Conditions/Payment Terms sections, full GST breakdown in summary
- `templates/invoice.template.ts` — Enhanced invoice PDF: Bill To recipient with GSTIN, HSN/SAC column when present, payment summary (subtotal/GST/total/paid/outstanding), bank details, signature/stamp, status watermarks (CANCELLED/PAID/PARTIALLY PAID)
- `pdf.service.ts` — `generate()`, `regenerateIfNeeded()`, `getOrCreate()`; fetches company branding, downloads images, generates PDF buffer, uploads via storage, stores `pdfUrl`/`pdfGeneratedAt`, records timeline + audit entries; `fetchQuotationData()` includes `validUntil`, `notes`, `termsAndConditions`, `paymentTerms`, client `gstin`, item `serviceName`/`hsnSacCode`; `fetchInvoiceData()` includes `displayStatus`, client `gstin`
- `pdf.controller.ts` — `generate` (POST body), `download` (GET params + `PDF_DOWNLOADED` timeline event), `regenerate` (POST params)
- `pdf.routes.ts` — `POST /generate`, `GET /:documentType/:documentId`, `POST /:documentType/:documentId/regenerate`
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Added `pdfUrl/pdfGeneratedAt` to Quotation+Invoice; `validUntil/notes/termsAndConditions/paymentTerms` to Quotation; `hsnSacCode/serviceName` to QuotationItem; `gstin` to Client
- `prisma/migrations/20260721000000_add_pdf_fields/migration.sql` — DDL for pdfUrl/pdfGeneratedAt
- `prisma/migrations/20260721000001_add_pdf_enhancement_fields/migration.sql` — DDL for validUntil, notes, termsAndConditions, paymentTerms, gstin, serviceName, hsnSacCode
- Fire-and-forget integration in `quotation.service.ts` — after `create`, `revise`, `approve`, `send`, `requestRevision`, `accept`, `reject`
- Fire-and-forget integration in `invoice.service.ts` — after `create`, `send`, `cancel`, `recordPayment`
- Routes mounted in `app.ts` as `app.use('/api/pdf', pdfRoutes)`
- `pdf.service.test.ts` — 32 tests (formatCurrency, formatDate, BASE_TEMPLATE, renderQuotationPdf including watermark/notes/terms, renderInvoicePdf including watermark/GSTIN/branding/items, validation)

**Frontend:**
- `types/index.ts` — Added `pdfUrl`, `pdfGeneratedAt`, `validUntil`, `notes`, `termsAndConditions`, `paymentTerms` to `Quotation` type
- `services/quotationService.ts` — Added `getPdfUrl()` and `regeneratePdf()` API methods
- `queries/useQuotations.ts` — Added `useQuotationPdfUrl()` query hook and `useRegenerateQuotationPdf()` mutation hook
- `pages/quotations/QuotationDetailPage.tsx` — Added Preview PDF, Download PDF, and Regenerate PDF buttons in page header actions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- PDF generation is fire-and-forget (`.catch(() => {})`) — failures never block main operations
- Uses built-in Node v24 `fetch()` for downloading company branding images
- Dynamic imports (`import('../pdf/pdf.service').then(...)`) used to avoid circular dependencies between quotation/invoice services and the pdf service
- `PDFDocument` type from `@types/pdfkit` requires `type PDFDocumentInstance = InstanceType<typeof PDFDocument>` workaround
- `valign: 'top'` removed from `doc.image()` calls (unsupported option)
- `tsconfig.json` updated: `"module": "commonjs"`, `"moduleResolution": "node"` — aligns with CJS runtime, allows no `.js` extensions in dynamic imports, fixes `ts-node-dev` compatibility
- `jest.config.js` `moduleNameMapper` for `.js` extension resolution retained as safety net
- Watermark uses `doc.save()`/`doc.restore()` with `doc.rotate()` for proper PDF graphics state management
- Frontend PDF preview/download uses same Pattern A as invoices: direct `<a href={pdfUrl} target="_blank">` links
- Prisma `findFirst` with `include` requires `as any` casts on related fields due to type inference issues after schema changes

### ✅ Frontend PDF Integration (Quotation + Invoice Detail)

**Quotation Detail Page (Admin):**
- **Preview PDF**: Opens PDF in new browser tab (`target="_blank"`)
- **Download PDF**: Downloads PDF via `<a download>` attribute
- **Regenerate PDF**: Calls `POST /api/pdf/QUOTATION/:id/regenerate`, invalidates query cache, shows toast

**Invoice Detail Page (Admin):**
- **Preview PDF**: Opens PDF in new browser tab (`target="_blank"`)
- **Download PDF**: Downloads PDF via `<a download>` attribute
- **Regenerate PDF**: Calls `POST /api/pdf/INVOICE/:id/regenerate`, invalidates query cache, shows toast
- Both pages use `useInvoicePdfUrl()` / `useQuotationPdfUrl()` hooks to fetch the latest PDF URL
- PDF URL resolved from query cache → entity record (`pdfUrl` field) as fallback

### ✅ Client Portal Quotation PDF — Single Source of Truth (v2)

**Frontend:**
- `pages/portal/PortalQuotationDetailPage.tsx` — REWRITTEN: PDF is the ONLY quotation view (no HTML fallback)
  - Fetches PDF URL via `useQuotationPdfUrl(id)` (same hook as admin detail page — byte-for-byte identical PDF)
  - Resolves `pdfUrl` from query cache → entity record `pdfUrl` field as fallback
  - When `pdfUrl` exists: renders embedded `<iframe>` with viewport-filling height (`calc(100vh - 280px)`, min 500px) and toolbar (Open, Download, Print buttons)
  - When no `pdfUrl` or PDF fails to load: shows error state with Retry button (no HTML fallback)
  - Removed all duplicate HTML quotation layout (PricingBreakdown, VersionItems components removed)
  - Preserves all acceptance workflow: Approve, Reject, Request Revision buttons
  - Preserves Version History tab (version metadata only: number, date, status, approvals) and Timeline tab
  - Header actions: Status badge + workflow buttons + PDF actions (Preview PDF, Download PDF) when available

**Backend (PDF generation fix):**
- `templates/base.template.ts` — `drawFooter()` rewritten: explicitly iterates all pages with `switchToPage()`, draws footer line and company info only on the last page, page numbers on all pages. Prevents implicit page creation from stale `doc.y` state after watermark/content operations.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- PDF is the single source of truth — client sees exact same document as admin (header, footer, branding, line items, totals, terms, signature, stamp, watermarks)
- No duplicate rendering logic — uses the admin-generated PDF directly via iframe
- No backend endpoint changes needed — `GET /api/pdf/QUOTATION/:id` already accessible to authenticated clients
- Admin PDF == Client PDF — both use `useQuotationPdfUrl(id)` hook which calls the same `GET /api/pdf/QUOTATION/:id` endpoint
- Error state with Retry instead of silent HTML fallback — ensures client always sees the authoritative PDF
- iframe height uses viewport-relative sizing to prevent blank space artifacts from fixed-height containers
- No new hooks or services needed — reuses existing `useQuotationPdfUrl` hook
- HTML fallback for quotations generated before PDF system was added
- Print uses `window.open(pdfUrl)` to leverage browser's native PDF viewer print dialog

### Optional Future Enhancements (Not Part of Current Scope)
- Update PRD Section 10 to clarify single workflow
- Update Technical Blueprint documentation
- Add end-to-end integration tests for the full Lead → Project → Invoice pipeline
